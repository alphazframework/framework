# Zest PHP Framework

**Note:** This repository contains the core files of the Zest framework If you want to build an application using Zest, 
visit the main [Zest repository](https://github.com/Softhub99/Zest).

Who is Zest For?
Zest is for PHP developers who want to build apps instead of coding common things like validation, routing, database manipulation, etc, from scratch. Zest offers a set of well-defined toolkits that take care of those things allowing you to focus on building your app.

The purpose of Zest Framework
As for PHP, there are many PHP frameworks available nowadays, so the question is raised as to why we/people should use ZestFramework. The main purpose of Zest framework is to provide a very lightweight framework without any external dependencies except core and autoloader.
